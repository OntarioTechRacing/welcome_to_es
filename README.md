# welcome_to_es

👋 **Welcome to the Embedded Software (ES) Department of Ontario Tech Racing!**

This markdown file documents how our department operates, the typical workflow and beginning steps
for all new members of ES.

> All TODO steps are block quoted like this.

## 1.0 General Department Breakdown

Embedded Software (ES) is the department in charge of regions covering Embedded Systems, higher
level programming and rapid systems prototyping.

Our department covers many aspects of engineering, primarily:

- 🤖 **Mechatronics Engineering** (embedded systems, control systems, electromechanical machines)
- ⚡ **Electrical Engineering** (circuits, electronics, digital systems, semiconductors)
- 💻 **Software Engineering** (version control, algorithms, data structures, networking)
- ⚙️ **Mechanical Engineering** (enclosures, vibrations)
- _And much more!_

Our primary projects fall within **6 main categories**:

1. 🔭 **Sensors**
    - Collect and forward sensor data
2. 📈 **Telemetry**
    - Process, visualize and interpret data
3. 🚀 **Controls**
    - Control systems, command and manage control loops
4. ⚡ **Hardware**
    - Design, build, test and integrate PCBs
5. 🎮 **Interfaces**
    - Design interfaces primarily for driver(s)
6. 🕹️ **Equipment**
    - Build equipment for testing, simulation, manufacturing, etc

Due to the nature of our department, we also work mostly with the following departments:

- **Hardware and Electronics (HE)**
    - Designing and building our PCBs, completing the hardware for our projects
- **Electric Drivetrain (EDT)**
    - Engineering all high voltage and drivetrain aspects of our team

## 2.0 Department Registration and Onboarding

Our department and wider OTR team uses a verity of tools to organize technical work and run
efficiently:

## 3.0 General Department Responsibilities & Policy

The following are the general responsibilities and policy for our department / OTR team.

> Please take note of these!

1. Weekly department meeting
2. 2 hour in-person minimum
    - All ES members must commit at least 2 hours of in-person work each week, this includes:
        - Working on your OTR project(s)
        - Contributing time to someone else's OTR project
        - Cleaning up / organizing team facilities
        - etc
    - Meetings including weekly department meetings do not count towards the 2 hours unless the
      meeting is specifically for working on a project or team responsibility
3. Active communications via Slack
4. Attending and supporting wider team meetings, work sessions, etc
    - ~1-2 sessions per month

## 4.0 General Department Documentation

All technical documentation about our department can be found on
the [embedded repository](https://github.com/OntarioTechRacing/embedded).

For new members there will be too much information to take in at once. We don't expect you to know
it all from the get go, but the department repository should be a point of reference going forwards.

> Please review the embedded
> repository [`README.md`](https://github.com/OntarioTechRacing/embedded/blob/main/README.md)
> for an overview of the technical conventions and workflow of our department.

## 5.0 Embedded Systems Onboarding

Whether you are looking to focus on low-level hardware programming, high-level scripts or anything
in between, all ES members should ideally contribute to development of OTR FSAE EV.

- Our primary goal is to support engineering on the FSAE EV
- High level programming (automation, CI/CD devops, ML, etc) are typically not priority as of the
  current state of OTR

Our module level hardware runs on most commonly on STM32 microcontrollers. A STM32 beginner guide
has been created on the embedded
repository: [stm32/getting_started](https://github.com/OntarioTechRacing/embedded/blob/main/resources/stm32/getting_started.md)

> Complete the STM32 getting started training.

## 6.0 Workflow

From a high-level view of our department, each member manages various projects. The projects are
assigned by member interest, skill-set and urgency.

Different projects follow different development cycles, you will be introduced to them towards the
start of your first project contribution.

You can view a list of our current ongoing and completed projects on monday.com (see department
board link above).

> Look at the scrum board to see if any projects labeled (upcoming) interest you. You might have a
> chance to contribute to a project as a project manager (PM) or task manager (TM).
